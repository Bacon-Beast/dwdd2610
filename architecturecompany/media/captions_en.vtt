00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.760
okay team today I'll be making whatever

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:12.960
random content comes to mind and hope

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.400
that the content creator penguin zo

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.400
notices so to begin I want to talk about

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.160
the 3D pen which I've seen circulating

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.320
around both the internet and different

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.359
stores in my

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.439
area for those of you that don't know

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:29.039
what that is it's a little tool that

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.880
heats up and it melts wax so that you

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.000
can draw with it

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.399
today I'll be pushing back on the 3D pen

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.680
because you know what else heats up to

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.440
unsafe temperatures and melts wax that

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.239
you can work with a hot glue gun you see

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.160
I've had this sucker since I was in high

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.320
school and I was doing all kinds of

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.199
stuff with it I was making myself phone

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.680
cases I was fixing ripped things like my

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.559
backpack this thing has lasted me

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.320
forever and it has way more uses than

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.399
some 3D pen that is like way too

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.280
expensive for what you get yet so here
